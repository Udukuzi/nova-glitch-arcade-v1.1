## 🎮 How to Demonstrate the Full Flow

### **Current Demo (Simple)**
The current implementation shows:
1. Mode selection with realistic details
2. Confirmation dialog with entry fees & prizes
3. Simulated deposit animation
4. Waitlist signup

### **To Show Complete Flow (Swap → AI → Play → Payout)**

You have **two options**:

---

## Option A: Narrate the Full Flow (Fastest - 2 minutes)

While showing the current demo, **verbally explain** each step:

### **Script:**

**[Show Mode Selection]**
"Here are our 5 game modes with realistic entry fees and dynamic NAG prizes calculated in real-time."

**[Click Kiddies Mode]**
"Let's enter Kiddies Mode - 5 USDC entry for a chance to win ~22,857 NAG tokens, worth about $9.60."

**[Show Confirmation]**
"The confirmation shows the entry fee, prize pool at 96% distribution, and win condition."

**[Click 'Simulate Entry']**
"In production, this triggers a multi-step flow:

1. **SWAP**: User swaps USDC for NAG via Jupiter aggregator
2. **DEPOSIT**: NAG tokens deposited to smart contract escrow
3. **AI CHECK**: Our AI agent verifies wallet authenticity, checks for bot behavior, analyzes input patterns
4. **PLAY**: Game launches with real-time AI monitoring
5. **RESULTS**: AI validates the score for impossible achievements
6. **PAYOUT**: Winner receives NAG instantly to their wallet"

**[Show Waitlist]**
"Users can join the waitlist for Q1 2026 launch when real funds go live."
