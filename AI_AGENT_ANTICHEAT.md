- Flags mathematically impossible achievements
- Cross-references with game physics limitations

### **3. Timing Anomalies**
- Tracks frame-perfect inputs beyond human capability
- Detects time manipulation attempts
- Monitors network latency exploitation

### **4. Behavioral Analysis**
- Machine learning model trained on legitimate gameplay
- Identifies deviation from human play patterns
- Real-time confidence scoring

## **PENALTY SYSTEM**

### **Tier 1 - Warning (1st Offense)**
- **Duration**: 24-hour temporary ban
- **Penalty**: Forfeit current entry fee
- **Status**: Account flagged for monitoring

### **Tier 2 - Suspension (2nd Offense)**
