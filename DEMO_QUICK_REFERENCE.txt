📝 NARRATION SCRIPT (2-3 Minutes):

[0:00-0:15] OPENING
  SHOW: Battle Arena modal
  SAY: "This is Nova Glitch Arcade's Battle Arena - a competitive 
       gaming platform powered by an AI agent that autonomously 
       manages bets and payouts using the x402 protocol on Solana."

[0:15-0:30] MODES
  SHOW: Hover over each mode
  SAY: "We have five game modes with age-appropriate tiers: 
       Kiddies for 7-12 at 5 USDC, Teenies for 13-17 at 10 USDC, 
       Anyone at 15 USDC, Pro for adults at 250 USDC, and free 
       Practice mode. All prizes calculated dynamically in NAG."

[0:30-0:45] CONFIRMATION
  SHOW: Click Kiddies Mode
  SAY: "Let's enter Kiddies Mode. 5 USDC entry, 96% to winner - 
       that's 22,857 NAG tokens. Highest score wins."

[0:45-1:00] START
  SHOW: Click "Simulate Entry"
  SAY: "When you click enter, the AI agent kicks off a five-step 
       autonomous process. Let me walk you through each step."

[1:00-1:20] STEP 1: SWAP
  SHOW: Step 1 animation
  SAY: "Step 1: The system swaps USDC to NAG via Jupiter 
       aggregator, finding the best route across all Solana DEXes. 
       This is a real mainnet swap using Jupiter V6."

[1:20-1:40] STEP 2: DEPOSIT
  SHOW: Step 2 animation
  SAY: "Step 2: The AI agent creates an x402 payment request and 
       deposits funds to smart contract escrow. The money is locked 
       until game completes - completely trustless."

[1:40-2:00] STEP 3: AI VERIFICATION
  SHOW: Step 3 animation with checks
  SAY: "Step 3: The AI agent verifies wallet authenticity, checks 
       transaction history, analyzes behavioral patterns, and runs 
       anti-cheat validation. Notice the checks appearing - wallet 
       verified, history checked, patterns analyzed, anti-cheat passed."

[2:00-2:15] STEP 4: PLAY
  SHOW: Step 4 with AI indicator
  SAY: "Step 4: The game starts with real-time AI monitoring. The 
       green indicator shows the AI is actively watching for cheating. 
       If you cheat, you get progressive penalties: 24-hour ban, 
       then 7-day ban, then permanent ban with wallet blacklist."

[2:15-2:30] STEP 5: PAYOUT
  SHOW: Step 5 animation
  SAY: "Step 5: Game completes, AI validates the score, and the 
       winner receives 22,857 NAG tokens instantly. No manual 
       processing, no waiting - just autonomous settlement 
       verified on-chain."

[2:30-2:45] COMPLETION
  SHOW: Waitlist screen
  SAY: "That's the complete flow. Right now this is a demo showing 
       the architecture. The games are fully playable, the Jupiter 
       swaps are real, but we're waiting for audited smart contracts 
       before handling real competition money. Launch is planned 
       for Q1 2026."

[2:45-3:00] CLOSING
  SHOW: Close modal
  SAY: "This AI agent autonomously handles everything - swaps, 
       escrow, verification, monitoring, and payouts. All on Solana, 
       all trustless, all transparent. That's Nova Glitch Arcade's 
       Battle Arena."
