STARTUP SOUND FILE NEEDED
========================

To complete the game-like startup effect, add a startup sound file:

File name: startup-sound.mp3
Location: frontend/public/startup-sound.mp3

The sound will automatically play when users enter the splash screen!

RECOMMENDED:
- Format: MP3, WAV, or OGG
- Duration: 2-4 seconds (matching the animation)
- Style: Arcade/retro game startup sound
- Volume: Will be set to 50% by default

OPTIONAL:
If you don't have a sound file yet, the splash screen will still work perfectly,
just without the audio. You can add it later anytime!
